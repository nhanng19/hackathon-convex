## üí° Inspiration

Finding a meal can be a real challenge, especially in a bustling city like Los Angeles where the options seem endless. My friend and I often struggled to settle on a restaurant when making dinner plans with a group, leading to frustration. That's when we came up with the idea for an app that's essentially Tinder for food. Our app streamlines the decision-making process by presenting users with curated food options that they can swipe through quickly. This not only helps users make choices faster but also allows them to potentially connect with fellow food enthusiasts for dining meetups. Our goal is to simplify the dining experience and foster connections over delicious food choices. After users are allowed to share their dining experiences and connect with friends or potential matches through our social platform.

## üíª What it does

Fooder Dating operates like a dating app, allowing users to swipe through curated food options and matching them with potential dining partners who share similar tastes. Our platform aims to facilitate enjoyable dining experiences and meaningful social interactions centered around food preferences.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How we built it

We developed Fooder Dating using modern web technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Next.js for frontend, and Convex for backend infrastructure. We leverage Google Maps API for location-based insights and Yelp API for restaurant data, enhancing the user experience with personalized recommendations and valuable information.
